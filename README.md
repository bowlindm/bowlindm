I love the intersection of Products, Projects, Programs, and People in highly technical and innovative businesses. This intersection, the ability to see the intersection, solve the problems and deliver at that intersection are my true passion in any role that I take on.

Currently my role is focused on leading up some amazing teams in Product and Engineering focused on changing the Solar landscape. (Palmetto).

Prior to Palmetto, I lead teams focused on Video Streaming (iStreamplanet (WarnerMedia Discovery). I have served as a Security and Compliance Program Manager for ForgeRock. Previously was a Portfolio Manager at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory leading up Product and Application delivery for the National Labs Operational Support Organization. I have Iead Product and Program teams for CenturyLink and startups. I have helped lead transformation in a Global Construction organization from on-prem Infrastructure and Application delivery to cloud and cloud native applications.

I spend my time free time in my garden or coaching Lacrosse for my girls lacrosse club or helping girls, women and people who identify as women get involved in STEM.
